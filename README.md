I've forked Carlos's Sketch plugin to incorporate Colormind's color scheme generator.

[Colormind](http://colormind.io) is a color scheme generator that uses deep learning. It can learn color styles from photographs, movies, and popular art. Different datasets are loaded each day. 

## Install
This plugin is still a work in progress, and will change as things are added

1. Download and open **[Appalette-master.zip](https://github.com/carlosarturo28/appalette/archive/master.zip)**.
2. Double click on `Appalette.sketchplugin` to install.  

## Usage

Bring up the Appalette Window either from the *Plugin menu* or via *keyboard shortcut*. Once opened, just select the App you want and press `rock it ⚡️`. The plugin will create a group with the palette.

## Shortcut

You can quickly access the Appalette window by using the keyword shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
